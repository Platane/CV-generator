CV-generator
============

I found that writing a well formated CV was no fun. Unlike writing an app that do it for me!

It parses a json file to generate the html cv.

And look! I add a really cool word cloud for the skills!

Here is the result : [CV-arthur-brongniart.html](http://arthur-brongniart.fr/Stockage/CV/CV-arthur-brongniart.html)

### Usage

You may wants to modify the json to make your own CV. This should work, feel free.
